<!-- insights -->
Navbar was just a component.

<!-- thoughts -->
payable - maybe a security feature 
string memory - won't want to pay for more gas
TransferStruct[] transactions; - transactions a list of new data type created

- two ways exist for imports->
   - import phoenix from '../images/phoenix.png'
   or
   import phoe from '../images/phoenix.png'
   - import { TransactionProvider } from './context/TransactionContext'

- () => {
   return ()
}
don't do any mistake also in () or {}

- prevState can't be accessed outside setToggle
- we return alert and just don't say alert try to think why?
- hooks can be declared only inside functions
-
